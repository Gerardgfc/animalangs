            <h2>What is Animalang?</h2>
            <div class="espacio">
                <p><b>Animalang</b> is a language learning platform available on the web. In August 2021, Animalang had over 50,000 registered students. Our courses cover English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Russian, Dutch, and Latin. In 2022, we will expand our courses to Japanese, Arabic, and Korean, which are already highly sought-after languages.</p>
                <p class="sub"><b>PERSONALIZED TEACHING WITH 24/7 TEACHERS</b></p>
                <p>Every person learns a language differently, and at Animalang, we understand that. That's why our main goal is to offer all our students access to private lessons through technology.</p>
                <p class="sub"><b>ENGAGING METHOD</b></p>
                <p>It's challenging to stay motivated when learning online, which is why at Animalangs we've created a method of 5 daily words and constant repetition that interacts with the student all the time. Our classes have a maximum duration of 7-12 minutes, during which the student practices continuously. We focus on reading, translation, comprehension, speaking, and writing, all areas that make up a language, so that it is learned and retained as much as possible.</p>
                <p class="sub"><b>ECONOMICAL AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHOD</b></p>
                <p>There are over 1.5 billion people in the world learning a language, and most do so to access better job opportunities. Unfortunately, learning a language is expensive and inaccessible for most. <br>At Animalangs, our courses cost a maximum of $12 per module or less (depending on the country you live in). There are no hidden fees, and you'll have access to highly specialized teachers who can give you advice and create a unique interaction with the student. Additionally, the teaching is intensive, meaning you learn much more at Animalangs than at a language school where you would pay a monthly fee of approximately $100 or even more. <br>
                At Animalangs, we believe that quality education can be achieved at an affordable price that everyone can afford. We believe that quality education should be accessible to all at a low cost.</p>
                <p class="sub"><b>OUR METHOD</b></p>
                <p>Our method of teaching 5 daily words is based on scientifically proven methodology that demonstrates students can retain 100% of the words and concepts learned. As our courses are very playful and fun, retention of these words reaches over 80% per class. As these words are reviewed in later lessons, retention can reach 100%. Translation, reading, speaking, and writing exercises are all part of the teaching. <br>
                In addition, the teacher will present grammatical structures throughout the course almost imperceptibly. Grammar is part of the course but is not a burden or mere "memorization"; it is explained as the student learns their 5 words in a very balanced and fun way. <br>
                At Animalangs, we always strive to improve. That's why we use student results and feedback to evolve and ensure we are providing the best language teaching in the world. Like languages, we never stand still in time.</p>
